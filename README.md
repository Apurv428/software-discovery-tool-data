## Overview

Software Discovery Tool is a tool for discovering open source software for zArchitecture/s390x for any Z operating system. The data for the software, such as their names and versions available, are contained in this repository. Please refer to the documentation in [this](https://github.com/openmainframeproject/software-discovery-tool) repo to learn more about the data directory structure.

### Data Files Sources
Our data files include:
- z/OS Software List
Linux Distributions supporting s390x packages:
- Debian 10 and 11
- ClefOS Epel 7
- OpenSUSE Tumbleweed and Leap
- Fedora 34

## Contributions
If you feel to add support of any package list, feel free to create an issue.
We are in need of people to help us enlarge the z/OS package list. If you find any package you use and is not present on the tool list, feel to create an issue all the same.
